# Simon-Game

This project was about building a **JavaScript** version of the famous electronic game called **Simon**.

The computer will randomly generate a serie of tones and the user will have to reproduce the exact same sequence.

Everytime the user succeeds, a new tone is added to the sequence.

Current session score and highest score are available when game is over.

I used **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**/**jQuery**.
